alphaLib
========
alphaLib is a library of R functions for defining trading strategies and for performing backtesting (both in-sample and out-of-sample).  
alphaLib can be thought of as a simpler and lighter version of the [quantstrat][1] package from the [TradeAnalytics][2] project.  

alphaLib functions can be used in [quantstrat][1]
