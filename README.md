alphaLib
========
An R function library for defining trading strategies and performing backtesting (both in-sample and out-of-sample).  
alphaLib can be thought of as a simpler and lighter version of the *quantstrat* package from the [TradeAnalytics][1] project.  

alphaLib functions can be used in  *quantstrat*
