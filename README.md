alphaLib
========
alphaLib is a library of R functions for defining trading strategies and for performing backtesting (both in-sample and out-of-sample).  
alphaLib can be thought of as a simpler and lighter version of the [quantstrat][1] package from the [TradeAnalytics][2] project.  
alphaLib functions can be used in conjunction with other packages like [TTR][3], [PerformanceAnalytics][4], and [quantmod][5].
