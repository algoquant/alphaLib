author: Jerzy Pawlowski (algoquant)

The *alphaLib* library is collection of *R* functions that allow specifying and backtesting trading strategies.
The *alphaLib* library is not an *R* package, so the source code in the files must be loaded using the function `source()`.

The script files for loading the *alphaLib* library, and for performing backtests using the *alphaLib* library are collected in the directory: [C:\\Develop\\R\\scripts](C:\\Develop\\R\\scripts)

Here are some of the source code files of the *alphaLib* library: 

+ *alphaModel.R* is the main collection of *R* functions,

+ *defaults.R* contains the default parameters used by the *alphaLib* library,

+ *riskLib.R* contains risk and statistical functions,

+ *optimLib.R* contains optimization functions,
